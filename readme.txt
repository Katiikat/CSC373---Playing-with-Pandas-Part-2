Assignment: Playing with Pandas Part 2
Date: Feb 7, 2021

Assignment Requirements: 
Scrub the data you collected last week yourself into a .csv file.
Using Pandas, import your .csv file into your Machine Learning Classifier application replacing the hardcoded 5 - 10 rows of your data from the last assignment hardcoded into your application.
Change any Source code needed to handle the much larger dataset.
Over comment almost every line of code.
Create a great user experience for the first time user, not a user experience for someone who is familiar with machine learning.
